OVERVIEW:
    This program uses different shaders and shading methods in the same web page to 
    simulate different effects.

INCLUDED FILES: 
    * img1.png, img2.png, img3.png - 512x512 image files to be rendered
    * sc1.jpg, sc2.jpg, sc3.jpg - screenshot of different combinations
    * glMAtrix_util.js - matrix utility JS file
    * README - this file
    * WebGL_A4.html - main file that renders the height map and allows viewing controls
    * webgl-utils.js - webgl utility JS file

USAGE:
    To see the height map, open WebGL_A4.html via a locally hosted webserver to see the canvas with the appropriate image. 

    Click and Drag: Orient map 

DISCUSSION:

I had some trouble with this project, especially understanding how to get Gourad lighting to appropriately show up. I lef that 
out of my final project because the fragments of it that I had were messing up the whole program. Again this project was almost 
an extension of P2, so there was a lot of refactoring code and not a lot of writing from scratch. My scroll wheel controls also 
inverted from what I wanted. I did not have time to implement a CSS file to format the controls, but they are still organized 
somewhat neatly.
