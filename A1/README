OVERVIEW:
    This program is a collection of HTML files that utilize WebGL to rotate shapes, change color with shaders and apply textures to the shapes. 

INCLUDED FILES: 
    * screenshots of different shaders in 'shader screenshots' folder
    * box.png - default texture included in project zip
    * glMAtrix_util.js -
    * mcstone.png - texture file for cube
    * README - this file
    * rotatecube.html - file displaying rotating cube
    * squarebasepyramid.html - file displaying rotating square-base pyramid

USAGE:
    To see the shapes, open rotatecube.html or squarebasepyramid.html in browser. Firefox is preferred but Chrome works.

DISCUSSION:
    I found myself overthinking this project. It looks, complicated but most of the code was already written. It was about knowing where to make small alterations 
    to get the desired result. Once I figured out where to add the lines to enable the object rotation, I was able to copy and paste the code and comment out the 
    axes that I did not want to rotate about. I had difficulty getting the textures to appear on my shapes. The chrome commands would not let the textures show on the shapes. 
    It took me a bit to understand the metrics for the shader values. I am used to rgb 0-255, but in this case there are four values between 0 and 1.0. I used a color code picker to find my desired color then just did some math to convert it into a format that the shaders would take.
