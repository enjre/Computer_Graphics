OVERVIEW:
    This program is a WebGL Solar System. It has some mouse controls. 

INCLUDED FILES: 
    * glMAtrix_util.js - matrix operations file
    * webgl-utils.js - WebGL utility file
    * README - this file
    * index.html - main driver file
    * functions.js - file containing main js operations and function
    * shaders/* - folder containing all shader files for pixels and vertices
    * textures/* - texture files for each planet
    * SC1, SC2, SC3 - screenshots of the results

USAGE:
    To see the shapes, open index.html in a browser. Firefox is preferred but Chrome works.

DISCUSSION:
    For this project, I consulted many online resources. There were existing WebGL System implementations online, but most of them 
    used other libraries like three.js. I found a useful glMatrix_utils.js file that had a bunch of matrix operations done so that 
    I did not have to do quite as much low level writing for the operations. I Did have trouble with the lighting however. I wanted 
    to use three.js for this project because it would have made my index file super simple, but decided against it because I figured
    it would be a good exercise to do it all myself. I put the functions in a new js file unlike previous projects because the 
    index file was getting too long to be readable. The same goes for the shaders, I learned that you can put shader functions 
    into their own files, so I did for organization sake. There are the .frag files for describing the pixel shaders, and the .vert 
    files for describing the vertext shaders. 

    The distances are not completely to-scale, so there are some instances where the moon will crash into mars or venus, but
    it just passed through them. I found some planet textures online and used those. I added all of the planets (minus Pluto, which 
    isn't a planet depending on who you ask). There are controls that allow you to speed up or slow down the orbit, as well as select 
    which planet the view is focusing on.



    The controls are as follows: 
    - Mouse wheel to zoom in and out
    - Click and drag to change view
    - Drag the speed slider at the bottom left to adjust the orbital speeds (0-10)
    - Click the name of the planet at the top right pane to select your central planet
